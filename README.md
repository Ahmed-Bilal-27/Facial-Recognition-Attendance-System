This was my semester project for Machine Learning course. It uses Google Firebase Database to compare faces with the stored images in database in realtime. It uses Face_Recognition package for face detection, face alignment, feature extraction and face recognition tasks. The source coe of the package can be found at https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition and documentation at https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html.
